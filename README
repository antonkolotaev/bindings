        ** Compiling bindings **


The compilation of the bindings is carried out by the autotools. The
Makefile.am is generated by a dedicated configure.in script.
The detection of boost stuff is achieved by the configure.in
script. Sofar, there is no proper detection of Python and in particular
of which version of Python should be used. This may be integrated to the
configure.in script also.

To properly finalize linking, all the library are installed in
premia_top_level_directory/lib.


Awkward stuff:
-------------

Although the extension for shared library on Darwin is .dylib, Python
only detects it if it ends in .so. So a tweak has been added in
Makefile.am to create a link ending in .so


How to compile:
--------------

> ./autogen.sh [--with-python=python2.7]

Note that if you have already run autogen.sh once, you can directly run 
> ./configure [--with-python=python2.7]

> make
> make install WWW=path_to_karrigell/www
